# CANDIDATE CODING ASSIGNMENT

## ASSIGNMENT
Create three text filters that can be applied to the given text and write both the the source and transformed text to the console.
The requested three filters are as follows:
1. Filter1 – filter out all the words that contains a vowel in the middle of the word – the centre 1 or 2 letters ("clean" middle is ‘e’, "what" middle is ‘ha’, "currently" middle is ‘e’ and should be filtered, "the", "rather" should not be) 
2. Filter2 – filter out words that have length less than 3 
3. Filter3 – filter out words that contains the letter ‘t’

## ASSUMPTIONS
1. The filters should be applied in the order listed in the assignment.
2. Punctuations are considered part of the word but removed before the vowel and length rules are applied.
