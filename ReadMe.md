# CANDIDATE CODING ASSIGNMENT

## Application

Dear Calastone,

This is my application which i believe solves the issue described. Within the src folder you will find my application seperated into 3 layers
TextFilterApp.Presentation (UI)
|
V
TextFilterApp.Application
|
V
TextFilterApp.Infrastructure

To run please run from TextFilterApp.Presentation.

## Unit Tests

Next to the src folder will be a tests folder. This will hold Unit tests for the application.
They all should pass as shown below.
